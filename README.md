Space Adventures

“Space Adventures” is a game in which the characters find themselves, right from the very beginning, on a spaceship together with other characters whom they do not even know. Before starting the game, players have options to choose a character, and a short description is provided for each option, including their qualities, strengths, and an image. Each quality and skill will be “rated” with stars so that players can get an idea of them.

The main idea is for the characters to work together, successfully complete missions, and return to Bulgaria. They have entered the spaceship through portals, without even knowing that they would end up in space.

Through my website “Space Adventures”, I explain the rules of the game, and it contains all the information related to the game. For example, it includes the ship’s crew (that is, the game characters), more detailed information about the crew, and the status of the ship, meaning its condition at the beginning of the game.

Installation steps:

Only the code that I have uploaded is needed. If, when starting my project, some of the images do not load, they will need to be downloaded to your device.

Instructions for using the “Space Adventures” website:

Thanks to the code and all the pages I have created, no matter which page you start with, it will lead you to the others through the navbar menu, which is visible on all pages.
